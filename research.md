### Overview: CRISP‑DM Methodology
CRISP‑DM (Cross‑Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a step‑by‑step process that guides the development of data analytics and machine learning projects. Its six phases are:

* Business Understanding: Define what business problem you’re solving.
* Data Understanding: Explore and verify the available data.
* Data Preparation: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
* Modeling: Build machine learning models (in our case, a recommendation engine).
* Evaluation: Test the model against business objectives.
* Deployment: Integrate the model into an operational system for users to access.
<br>
#### Day 1: Business & Data Understanding and Planning
1. Define Technical & Data Requirements
Business Understanding:

#### Objective: Provide personalized financial product recommendations to customers based on their behavior, such as transaction history, spending patterns, and product usage.
* Stakeholders: Bank’s marketing teams, risk management, IT, and customer service.
##### Data Requirements:
<br>
* Customer Data: Transaction history, demographic details, product usage, account information.
* Product Data: Details on available financial products, eligibility criteria, product benefits.
* Technical Data Sources:
* Data stored in the bank’s databases (e.g., SQL, data lakes) that will be ingested into Azure.
* Real‑time or batch data feeds (e.g., via Azure Data Factory pipelines).
<br>
##### Technical Requirements:

Cloud & Environment:
Azure Cloud Services: For data storage, compute (using Azure ML), and integration.
Microsoft Fabric: As the development and orchestration environment.
Storage & Compute: Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Machine Learning for model development.
2. Integration and API Requirements
APIs:
RESTful APIs: Create endpoints that allow your recommendation engine to receive customer data and return product recommendations.
Integration Points:
Integration with the bank’s internal systems (e.g., CRM or core banking systems).
Use of Azure API Management to secure and manage these endpoints.
Explanation:
REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface; it’s a way for different software systems to communicate over the internet.
3. Security and Compliance Requirements
Security Measures:
Encryption: Ensure that data is encrypted both at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being transferred).
Access Control: Implement role‑based access so that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive data.
Compliance:
Regulations: Follow data privacy laws (such as GDPR) and financial regulations (like PCI‑DSS for payment data).
Audit Trails: Maintain logs of data access and model usage.
4. User’s Device Considerations
Accessibility:
Ensure that the demo and any user interfaces are accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Responsive Design: Use design best practices so the solution displays correctly on various screen sizes.
5. Operational and Support Requirements
Monitoring & Logging:
Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for real‑time monitoring of system performance.
Establish alerting mechanisms for any anomalies.
Documentation & Training:
Prepare support documentation and user guides.
Plan for initial training sessions for the bank’s operational team.
6. Slide Presentation and Demo Preparation
Content Outline for Slides:
Introduction: Problem statement and objective.
Methodology: Brief explanation of CRISP‑DM.
Technical Architecture: Overview of Azure, Microsoft Fabric, and the integration points.
Security & Compliance: Key measures in place.
Demo Walk‑through: Step‑by‑step demonstration of the POC.
Next Steps: Roadmap for full‑scale implementation.
Day 2: Data Preparation & Modeling
Data Preparation (CRISP‑DM Phase 3)
Data Ingestion:
Connect to bank data sources using Azure Data Factory pipelines.
Import sample datasets into Microsoft Fabric.
Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Remove duplicate or irrelevant records.
Normalize data (making sure data fields have consistent formatting).
Explain in simple terms: This step is like “tidying up” your data so that the computer can understand it easily.
Modeling (CRISP‑DM Phase 4)
Model Selection:
Choose recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering or content‑based filtering.
Collaborative Filtering: Finds patterns by looking at what similar customers have chosen.
Content‑Based Filtering: Recommends products similar to those a customer has already shown interest in.
Model Building:
Use Azure Machine Learning to build and train the model.
Validate the model with historical data.
Integration During Modeling:
Begin developing the REST APIs that will expose the model’s predictions to other systems.
Implement API endpoints in a secure environment using Azure API Management.
Day 3: Evaluation, Deployment, and Demo Preparation
Evaluation (CRISP‑DM Phase 5)
Model Testing:
Compare the model’s recommendations against a validation dataset.
Use simple metrics (accuracy, precision) to measure performance.
Explain in simple terms: We check if the “guesses” our system makes are correct by comparing them with actual outcomes.
Stakeholder Feedback:
Share preliminary results with non‑technical stakeholders to get feedback on the recommendations’ relevance.
Deployment (CRISP‑DM Phase 6)
Integration into Microsoft Fabric:
Deploy the model as a service accessible via the APIs.
Ensure that the solution is secured, monitored, and scalable.
Operational Setup:
Finalize monitoring dashboards and alert systems using Azure Monitor.
Prepare a rollback plan and support documentation.
Final Demo and Slide Presentation
Slide Presentation Creation:
Create slides that cover:
The business challenge and objectives.
A high‑level overview of CRISP‑DM and how each phase was tackled.
The technical architecture (Azure Cloud, Microsoft Fabric, APIs).
Data security, integration, and compliance measures.
A live demo (or recorded simulation) showing how the recommendation engine works.
Dry‑Run Demo:
Perform a rehearsal to ensure that all systems work smoothly and that the narrative is clear for a non‑technical audience.
Summary: 3‑Day Step-by‑Step Plan
Day 1: Planning & Requirements

Kickoff meeting and requirement gathering.
Define business, data, technical, integration, security, user device, and operational requirements.
Outline slide presentation structure.
Day 2: Data Preparation & Modeling

Ingest, clean, and transform data in Microsoft Fabric.
Develop and train the recommendation model using Azure ML.
Build integration points (APIs) and begin testing them.
Day 3: Evaluation, Deployment & Demo

Evaluate the model’s performance with sample data.
Deploy the model as a service and complete integration.
Finalize security, monitoring, and operational support setups.
Prepare and rehearse the slide presentation and demo.
This plan provides a clear roadmap from understanding the business problem to deploying a working prototype. It uses familiar cloud tools (Azure, Microsoft Fabric) and breaks down technical steps into understandable segments. Please let me know if you need any further details or adjustments to the plan.
